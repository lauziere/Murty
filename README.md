# Python3 implementation of Murty's algorithm \[1\]

This repository is a Python3 rewrite of an R implementation of Murty's algorithm \[3\]. NumPy and SciPy are the only dependencies. 

The R implementation allows a choice of minimization vs maximization of the objective and allows for the linear program to be solver by either the Hungarian algorithm or as a general linear program. Both extensions will be added to this repository; however, it currently only supports minimization via Jonker-Volgenant algorithm. 

This Jonker-Volgenant algorithm is provided by Scipy: scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment

Murty's algorithm yields the top *K* solutions to a size *n* assignment problem. This implementation requires a square (*n*x*n*) matrix. 

# Use

The function 'getkBestNoRankHung(matNR, k_bestNR)' takes in as input the *n*x*n* matrix 'matNR' and a positive integer *K*: 'k_bestNR' specifying the number of desired solutions. The function returns two numpy arrays: 'all_solutions' and 'all_objectives'. 'all_solutions' is of size '(k_bestNR, n, n)' and 'all_objectives' is size 'n'. The solutions are permutation matrices matching row indices to columns.
